How to Play



&nbsp;	A grid of tiles appears each round



&nbsp;	Exactly one tile is different



&nbsp;	Click the odd tile as fast as possible



&nbsp;	Non-odd tiles fade over time



&nbsp;	Faster clicks give higher score



&nbsp;	Clicking a wrong tile reduces score and hearts



&nbsp;	Losing all hearts ends the game



&nbsp;	Press Retry to play again





Rules Implemented



&nbsp;	The game randomly selects one rule each round:



&nbsp;	Prefab Difference Rule	



&nbsp;		One tile uses a different prefab while the remaining tiles share the same prefab.



&nbsp;	Rotation Difference Rule



&nbsp;		One tile is rotated differently compared to the others.





Adaptive Difficulty (Brief)



&nbsp;	Difficulty adjusts dynamically based on player performance:



&nbsp;	Faster and more accurate players experience:



&nbsp;		Faster tile fading



&nbsp;		Less time to react

&nbsp;	

&nbsp;	Slower or error-prone players experience:



&nbsp;		Slower fading



&nbsp;		More reaction time





If more development time were available, I would add:



&nbsp;	1. More odd-one-out rules (color, shape, pattern count)



&nbsp;	2. Better visual polish (animations, transitions, feedback)



&nbsp;	3. Sound and music settings (volume, mute options)



&nbsp;	4. Accessibility options (color-blind friendly mode)



&nbsp;	5. Leaderboards or social sharing for replayability
